# JavaCoroutines

**JavaCoroutines** is a Java library that introduces coroutine-like functionality using the `@Suspend` annotation, inspired by Kotlin's `suspend` functions. This library allows you to write asynchronous and non-blocking code in Java with a similar approach to Kotlin coroutines.

## Features

- Simple `@Suspend` annotation to mark coroutine methods.
- Coroutine manager to handle coroutine execution and state management.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing Java projects.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.coroutines:java-coroutines:1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

### Usage

To use JavaCoroutines, simply annotate your methods with `@Suspend` and manage coroutines using the provided coroutine manager. Here is a basic example:

```java
import com.coroutines.Suspend;

public class Example {
    @Suspend
    public void asyncMethod() {
        // Your asynchronous code here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();
        CoroutineManager manager = new CoroutineManager();
        manager.run(example::asyncMethod);
    }
}
```
